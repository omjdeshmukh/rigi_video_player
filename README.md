**Deadline: 5 Days**

**Objective:**
Create a Video Player application using React.js or Next.js to allow users to play videos from a playlist. The app should support features like seeking, timer, autoplay, and speed selector. Additionally, users should be able to reorder the playlist.

   - Play/Pause toggle.
   - Seek functionality.
   - Timer displaying current playback time and duration.
   - Autoplay.

**NOTE**: Player component is preferred when built in house. If you're facing any issue, feel free to use external libraries for player based on your preference.

2. **Playlist Component:**
   - Develop a playlist component to display and manage videos.
   - Allow users to reorder videos in the playlist.
   - Clicking on a video in the playlist should load and play that video in the video player.
